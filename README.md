# Image Pop-up on Hover with GSAP
Create a div, and when the mouse hovers over it, a picture should pop up and then disappear.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Hover your mouse over the image, and it will smoothly scale up. Move your mouse away to return it to its original size.


## Customization

You can customize the behavior by changing the image URL to display your desired image.
You can also adjust the animation duration and easing by modifying the GSAP animation properties in the <script> section of the HTML file.

# Dependencies
