# Image Pop-up on Hover with GSAP
Create a div, and when the mouse hovers over it, a picture should pop up and then disappear.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Hover your mouse over the image, and it will smoothly scale up. Move your mouse away to return it to its original size.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior by changing the image URL to display your desired image.
